Hello everyone! In this post, I’d like to share an amazing experience I had in Vietnam as a computer science student during my internship in Hanoï.

In June 2023, I traveled to Vietnam for a four-month internship at the University of Science and Technology of Hanoï under the supervision of Dr. Tung. My project focused on detecting small objects on embedded devices, specifically improving traffic sign detection models to enhance long-range detection. Throughout the internship, I gained valuable knowledge in computer vision, built a custom dataset of Vietnamese traffic signs, and developed a classification model. I also fine-tuned the YOLOv5 model for detection tasks. For more details on the project, feel free to check out [my previous blog post](https://charlovietnam.blogspot.com/), and you can also access my internship report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17s4CpAUrpXZSTho6TbLhJnnENFN_3FaQ/view?usp=drive_link).

During my journey, I had the chance to explore all of Northern Vietnam and made some incredible connections along the way. You can find descriptions of some of our trips here. As a French student, I was treated exceptionally well, and we even organized a French Culture Discovery Day at the University, where we made crêpes and hosted cheese and wine tasting workshops for Vietnamese students and their families.

To my surprise, I was also interviewed by a local TV channel! You can check out the clip here. So many other crazy stories happened to me in Vietnam, and it made me wonder why life there felt so much more exciting than in France. I understood that in Vietnam people are generally more welcoming than other european countries and this was what made my stay so interesting and enriching. People expressed their feelings with their face and gestures because we couldn't have a conversion (impossible for me to talk in Vietnamese).

Anyway, this was one of the best experiences I've had traveling the world, in every possible way. Professionally, I discovered an incredible field that I continued exploring later in my studies. Personally, I met amazing people from all over the world—Vietnam, Japan, Russia, and of course, France—and immersed myself in the rich culture and breathtaking beauty of Vietnam.
